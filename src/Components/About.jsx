      </p>

      <h2>How the Data Works:</h2>
      <p>
        The app pulls superhero data from the <strong>Superhero API</strong>, which includes power stats like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Strength:</strong> A measure of a hero's physical power and combat ability</li>
        <li><strong>Intelligence:</strong> The hero's ability to think, strategize, and solve problems</li>
        <li><strong>Speed:</strong> The hero's speed and agility, both in and out of combat</li>
        <li><strong>Durability:</strong> The hero's resistance to damage and their ability to withstand injury</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Users can interact with these stats through dynamic sliders and view side-by-side comparisons between different superheroes.
      </p>
